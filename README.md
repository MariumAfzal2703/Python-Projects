Python Projects

Welcome to my Python Projects Repository ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains a collection of small to medium-scale Python projects that I built while learning and practicing programming.
Each project is organized in its own folder with clear documentation and a main.py file.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Strengthen core Python concepts

Explore practical use cases through mini projects

Build a strong foundation for AI, automation, and robotics

ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each project has its own directory

Every directory contains:

main.py â†’ the main Python script

README.md â†’ project-specific documentation
